Atlantic benthic foraminifera $\delta^{13}$C ($\permil$) (ka BP) during the Holocene and LIG depicted spatially. Three specific regions are highlighted during the Holocene and LIG: The North East (magenta, red), Equatorial (yellow, green), and Namibian Coast (cyan, blue). In the centre, box plots are given for each region (filled colours match to region outline colours). The $\delta^{13}$C colourbars ($\permil$) function as both the box plot y-axis and the spatial plot colourbar. The size of the points represents the numbers of data points.

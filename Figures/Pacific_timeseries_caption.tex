Pacific benthic foraminifera $\delta^{13}$C ($\permil$) divided by into regions through time (ka BP) during the Holocene and LIG; North of 15$^\circ$N, South of -15$^\circ$S, and equatorial between 15$^\circ$N and -15$^\circ$S. Lines show the averages of the points in each region, based on the points with interpolation. Blue and Cyan are deeper than 2500m, while red and magenta are shallower than 2500m.

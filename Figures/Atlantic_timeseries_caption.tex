Atlantic benthic foraminifera $\delta^{13}$C ($\permil$) divided by into regions through time (ka BP) during the Hol and LIG; Nth of 15$^\circ$N, Sth of -15$\circ$S, and eq between 15$^\circ$N and -15$^\circ$S. Lines show the averages of the points in each region, based on the points with interpolation. Blue and Cyan are dper than 3000m, while red and magenta are shwer than 3000m.

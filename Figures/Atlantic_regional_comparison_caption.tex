Atlantic benthic foraminifera $\delta^{13}$C (left y-axis, $\permil$) during the Holocene and LIG for the previously defined regions; North East, Equatorial, and Namibian Coast. Data is presented in discrete slices spanning 1000 years Circular, transparent points connected by lines are individual proxies. Black points represent $\delta^{13}$C. For each slice, there is a corresponding averaged depth (right y-axis, m), with 1 standard deviation either side shown in the bars. Average points with a average slice depth within $\pm$300m of the mean core depth across all slices is represented with a square point. However, if the average slice depth shallower than 300m is shown in a upward triangle, and deeper than 300m is shown in a downward triangle. Shading shows 1 standard deviation either side of the mean (where more than 1 points exists)
